# StobeServer Agent Notes

## Start here

This is the PHP/PostgreSQL server for the [STOBE Kenshi client](https://github.com/Dwemer-Dynamics/STOBE). Read [architecture, diagnostics and custom extensions](docs/agent-guide.md) and [setup and validation](docs/building.md) before choosing a component. Ship these guides and this file with the server application.

Confirm repository, branch, working tree and requested scope. Distinguish a source checkout from a running server with user data. Preserve credentials, profiles, memories, installed extensions and unrelated changes. Keep generated/runtime files out of source PRs. Use focused draft PRs; merging, releases, migrations and deployment require their own authorization. Assess related CHIM and Dialectic server changes independently.

## Playthrough Saves

### Table policy and comments

- Read [lib/playthrough_policy.php](lib/playthrough_policy.php) before changing capture, restore, fresh starts or table comments. It is the authoritative table list; do not maintain a second list or fixed table count here.
- `pts_table_policy()` classifies tables as `playthrough`, `global`, `mixed` or `infrastructure`. `pts_playthrough_tables()` selects playthrough and mixed tables.
- Global tables remain live across saves and new playthroughs. These include credentials, connectors, reusable profiles/presets, import rules, prompts/actions and the explicitly listed shared libraries. Global means excluded from switching, not read-only.
- `conf_opts` and `general_settings` are mixed: only gameplay rows travel with a save. Use `is_global_setting()` in [lib/playthrough_selection.sql](lib/playthrough_selection.sql); do not capture or replace these tables wholesale. Player identity, party and gameplay timestamps must not become global.
- `database_versioning` stays live; migration metadata belongs in the save manifest. Unknown/plugin tables are unmanaged: never auto-enrol them or clear them just because they exist in `public`.
- Selected public tables have exactly `Playthrough Manager Backed Up` as their PostgreSQL table comment. Excluded public tables have a NULL/blank comment. Comments describe the policy; they do not control capture.
- [debug/db_updates.php](debug/db_updates.php) calls `pts_update_playthrough_policy()` to synchronise comments idempotently. Change the policy and update path together rather than applying a one-off database label.

### StobeServer specifics

- STOBE stores world knowledge, world state, autonomy and player-base progress with the playthrough where listed. In particular, `world_state_addendum`, `world_state_addendum_custom` and `world_state_definition` are playthrough data. Older policies that omitted these three tables initialise them empty. Reusable voice/name pools and `stobe_settings_presets` remain global. Preserve STOBE's additional before-switch recovery-copy path.

### New, switch and restore

- Save identity is frozen in the schema manifest under `player_identity` by `playthrough_identity()` in `lib/playthrough_selection.sql`. CHIM/DIALECTIC store character name and level; STOBE stores player squad member names. Dropdowns read saved metadata, never current gameplay to label another save. Legacy saves fall back to existing metadata without inventing a level. STOBE identity uses saved squad lists with an NPC faction/type fallback, excluding saved death states/flags and death-event actors. Sleeping or unconscious members remain eligible. SQL API upgrades refresh existing party metadata from each archive; legacy NULL manifests remain NULL and picker reads remain read-only.

- [lib/playthrough_home.php](lib/playthrough_home.php) provides the shared `pth_change()` operation for home controls and the manager. Keep its runtime barrier, advisory lock, stale-state token and transaction boundaries intact.
- Switching prepares and validates the target privately, saves current progress, then activates the target and active-save metadata in one transaction. Failures before commit roll back.
- [lib/playthrough_fresh.php](lib/playthrough_fresh.php) empties selected data in a private stage for New playthrough. It starts with no encountered NPCs, memories or gameplay progress, while activation preserves global tables and global rows of mixed tables.
- Restore replaces selected rows in existing public tables. Preserve table identities, views, triggers and excluded data. Never solve a dependency failure with a blanket schema replacement or cascading deletion.
- [lib/playthrough_runtime.php](lib/playthrough_runtime.php) drains active work, blocks new game requests during switching and refreshes persistent workers afterward. This is not a restart of PostgreSQL, Apache or the whole distro. Report worker-readiness warnings even after a successful database commit.
- Server saves do not change game save files. Close the game, switch the server playthrough, wait for confirmation, then load the matching game save. Character names do not automatically select a server playthrough.

- Home-picker deletion requires exact `Delete` text and fresh active/target tokens. `pth_delete()` shares the retention lock, rejects active/default/pinned/shared-schema saves, and deletes tables plus schema with RESTRICT in one transaction. Never replace this with a cascading schema drop or an automatic write retry. Deletion does not switch live gameplay or restart workers.

### Download and import

- `lib/playthrough_transfer.php` and `ui/api/playthrough_transfer.php` own `.playthrough.zip` transfers. Home and manager share `ui/tmpl/playthrough_transfer_controls.php` and its script/styles.
- Export active progress freshly; export inactive saves from their frozen schema. Normalize older archives through the selected-table policy before packaging. Preserve identity and owned or unowned sequence state. Never include global tables or global rows from mixed settings.
- Import only structured, checksummed table data. Never execute uploaded SQL, defaults, triggers or paths. SQL identifiers/types come from the current policy/catalog or reviewed legacy conversions; ZIP entries are streamed without extraction.
- Import creates a new inactive save, with explicit mapping to existing global profiles when fingerprints do not match. Preserve global profiles and live progress. Reuse private upgrade/validation, runtime drain, retention locking and transaction boundaries; validation temporarily exercises restore in a rolled-back subtransaction.
- Transfers use session-owned temporary jobs, CSRF-protected writes, streamed downloads and idempotent import results. Limit expanded transfers to 20 GB and individual rows to 32 MB. Temporary files expire after 24 hours and are swept when another transfer starts.

### Older saves and policy changes

- Read [lib/playthrough_schema.php](lib/playthrough_schema.php), [lib/playthrough_upgrade.sql](lib/playthrough_upgrade.sql) and [lib/playthrough_migrations.php](lib/playthrough_migrations.php) together. Upgrade a private stage to the current schema before activation.
- When membership changes, assess the manifest policy version, accepted versions, SQL API readiness check and missing-table rules together.
- Known omissions from older policies may be created empty. Keep `empty_tables` distinct from tables needing content migrations; never fill intentionally empty gameplay tables from the currently active playthrough.
- Reject unsupported versions, missing required data, invalid shared-profile references and unsafe external foreign-key dependencies before activation. Do not silently weaken validation to load an incompatible save.

### Automatic saves and cleanup

- [lib/playthrough_preferences.php](lib/playthrough_preferences.php) keeps saves triggered by loading an older game save enabled; the user controls the rollback threshold in in-game days.
- [lib/playthrough_retention.php](lib/playthrough_retention.php) owns cleanup rules, with storage categories in [lib/playthrough_categories.php](lib/playthrough_categories.php). Keep storage reporting and cleanup scopes aligned.
- Cleanup evaluates enabled category rules without a separate user-facing master toggle. Age-based rules use days; older-event cleanup is off by default. Saved-copy retention has no maximum by default.
- A Playthrough Save contains selected mod data. It is not a full database backup; the Dashboard owns Distro-wide database exports.

### Validation

- Use disposable databases for New, switch, restore, migration and cleanup probes. Never test destructive operations on the user's active playthrough.
- For policy changes, check capture and A-to-B-to-A restoration, an empty New playthrough, unchanged global and unmanaged data, mixed-row filtering, old-policy omissions, comment synchronisation run twice, and rollback on invalid input or dependencies.
- For runtime/API changes, also check stale requests, concurrent switching, request blocking and worker readiness. Use existing checks or focused scratch probes rather than adding a large test harness.
- Read the sibling servers independently before a shared change; their schemas and rollback details differ. Report source, disposable-database, local deployment and in-game evidence separately.

### Required rollback recovery saves

- `lib/playthrough_guard.php` inspects incoming game timestamps before bootstrap writes. A threshold-triggered rollback must commit its selected-table snapshot and manager entry before pruning.
- Automatic saves and rollback failures must never pause mod processing. The rollback journal is diagnostic only; legacy pending markers and unreadable journals must not block requests, workers or cleanup. Keep the existing barrier for explicit manual playthrough switching separate from automatic saves.
- Failed capture skips pruning for that request while normal request processing continues. A later pruning failure may be partial: keep its recovery copy pinned, report the failure, and continue processing. A new attempt captures current progress again rather than reusing a copy from before intervening gameplay writes.
- `X-Playthrough-Save` carries fixed versioned operation IDs/statuses to the plugin's existing HTTP path. Keep all three products' notification wording aligned, deduplicate repeated notices, and display them through the game HUD after loading. Preserve each product's existing day threshold and saved preferences.

### Game-time dynamic profiles

`lib/dynamic_profile_scheduler.php` owns automatic scheduling. Profile metadata sets `DYNAMIC_PROFILE_INTERVAL_DAYS` (default 1), `DYNAMIC_PROFILE_MIN_EVENTS` (30), and `DYNAMIC_PROFILE_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` (5 real minutes per NPC). All three conditions must pass. Narrator settings use the same keys in `core_narrator`.

`DYNAMIC_PROFILE_CLOCK` and `DYNAMIC_PROFILE_STATE_*` in `conf_opts` are playthrough data, as are explicit manual requests under `DYNAMIC_PROFILE_MANUAL_*`. Reusable profile policy stays global. Eventlog's `dynamic_profile_pending` flag lets the worker account delivered, relevant events before age cleanup; old restored rows start accounted. Combat barks remain context but do not count toward the trigger.

The worker visits all known eligible NPCs, accounts at most 200 events per pass, and generates for at most one NPC per pass. It respects profile/NPC disables, locks, selected fields and the interaction switch. Failed attempts consume cooldown only. Generated fields, recovery history and progress commit together after checking the timeline and current profile. Legacy client timer batches are ignored; manual actions use the explicit manual route.
